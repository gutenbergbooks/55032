<h2><a name="DECLARATION_OF_FAITH" id="DECLARATION_OF_FAITH"></a>DECLARATION OF FAITH.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Doubtless</span> many who take up this book, and glance carelessly at its
pages, will exclaim, “What! more Spiritualism!” To which remark I
answer, yes, more Spiritualism, an unequivocal, undisguised, positive
Spiritualism&mdash;confirmed by many years of careful observation, study, and
experience, and of which this book is the legitimate outgrowth. Eight
years have elapsed since my first volume&mdash;“Poems from the Inner
Life”&mdash;was given to the world (to the Preface of which I now refer for
any explanation concerning my mediumship). During that interval of time,
the ranks of the believers in Spiritualism have steadily increased in
numbers, its phenomena, presenting an array of well-established facts,
have challenged the investigation of some of the first scientific minds
of the age, and its philosophy has done more towards liberating the
human mind from the thraldom of old superstitions and creeds than any
other form of faith which has arisen for centuries. But as yet, it has
not secured that prestige of popularity and respectability which the
combined influence of age, wealth, and organized action ever afforded.
Consequently, those who are “named by its name” must be prepared to meet
the anathemas of religious bigots&mdash;the lofty scorn of those who are wise
in their own conceit&mdash;the scurrilous attacks of those who would divert
attention from their own infamy and the petty irritations of a numerous
pack who follow at the heels of every new movement, and ever distinguish
themselves by noise rather than by knowledge. As a participant in this
great movement, I have found such attacks to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>{6}</span> helps rather than
hinderances to my progress, inasmuch as I have been enabled to define my
own positive and affirmative position more clearly from the negations of
the opposers of Spiritualism.</p>

<p>We are told that “it is not a Religion.” But after a long and careful
study of the past and present, I have yet to find any phase of faith,
which, in its very inception has commenced so directly at the root of
all necessary reform, viz., the purification and harmonious development
of the human body. This primary and fundamental truth has been taken as
a starting-point&mdash;it has been enunciated from the spirit world&mdash;repeated
by the inspirational speakers&mdash;has been interwoven with all the
spiritualistic literature, and has found a practical application in the
Children’s Lyceums. The religion that teaches, “Take care of the soul,
and let the body take care of itself,” will inevitably defeat its own
purposes, and has already been taught long enough for us to know that it
is a failure. No other form of faith ever brought the spiritual world so
near, <i>as to banish its supernatural character, and place it within the
province of natural law</i>. No other form of faith has <i>illustrated</i> the
fact <i>so clearly</i>, that just as we go out of this world, so do we enter
upon the next, thereby presenting a more rational incentive to endeavor,
than the rewards of Heaven or the punishments of Hell; and no other from
of faith has so effectually dissipated the idea of an inane and
purposeless life in the future, and given to the angels a more exalted
employment than “loafing around the throne.” It also teaches that
mediumship, under proper circumstances, is a <i>healthy, harmonious, and
normal development of human nature</i>, and that communion with the
spiritual world is not interdicted, and no more impossible than any
other attainment that lies in the direct line of natural law, human
progress, and scientific investigation. This to me, and to those who
have accepted Spiritualism thoughtfully and sincerely, makes it <i>a
religion indeed</i>, and the positive assertions of any number of
intellectual or religious “authorities” to the contrary cannot make it
otherwise.</p>

<p>We have been told again and again, that “Spiritualism is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a>{7}</span>
Supernaturalism,” that we believe in miracles, which are contrary to the
“methods” of God’s government. We have denied this repeatedly, assuming
that we ourselves had the best right to say what we did believe; but our
denial has not been accepted, and the reason is obvious. Any number of
scholastic discourses, elaborately written essays, and eloquent appeals
to popular prejudice, would lose their pith and marrow, and be found
wanting, if this false predicate, this fabricated nucleus for their
logic should be disallowed.</p>

<p>Again, we are told that “Spiritualism is not Science;” to which we
reply, that Spiritualism has presented facts and phenomena which the
later discoveries in Science are tending both to explain and
substantiate. It has been demonstrated that it is not the eye that sees,
the ear that hears, or the nerves that feel, but each of these avenues
of sense serves to convey the vibrations of the surrounding “ether” to
the central consciousness, which alone is possessed of the power of
perception. Since this is so, who shall dare place a limit to the
possibilities of that consciousness, of which so little is definitely
known? Or why should any man prescribe, as a standard for all others,
the limitations of his own feeble consciousness. A modern reasoner tells
us that “if the bodily ear receives vibrations from one atmosphere, it
<i>cannot</i> receive them from another, and no fiction of an inner ear can
give genuineness to voices and whispers of a spiritual tongue.” Since,
however, it is not the outer ear, but the inner consciousness, that
hears, a quickening of its perceptions will allow it to catch the
vibrations from another atmosphere, and Spiritualism demonstrates, by
indisputable facts, that this is so. Also, that this is not an
<i>abnormal</i> condition, but <i>perfectly legitimate</i> to certain states of
the inner consciousness.</p>

<p>The revelations of the spectroscope, and the investigations of some of
the greatest scientific minds of the present day, have determined the
existence of a higher scale of vibrations than those which fall within
the ordinary range of human vision. All the objects and forms of life
comprehended in that scale, although so closely blended and interwoven
with the vibrations of our own plane of existence, are lost to our dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a>{8}</span>
perceptions, unless, through some physical or mental condition, there is
a quickening of our inner consciousness. When this comes, as it has
again and again to many, we have revelations from the “<i>spirit world</i>,”
which is, after all, but a finer <i>material</i> world, as real, as
substantial, as objective, and as directly within the province of
universal law, as that which we now inhabit. That we should be made
sensibly aware of this higher life, under certain legitimate conditions,
is perfectly <i>natural</i>. Indeed, it would be strange, with the uniformity
of succession and development which pervades all things, if we were not.
It is not a world that is <i>possible</i>, but <i>actual</i>, not one that <i>might</i>
be, but <i>is</i>.</p>

<p>In this matter, intelligent Spiritualists range themselves side by side
with those of whom Professor Tyndall has said, “You never hear the
really philosophical defenders of the doctrine of uniformity speaking of
<i>impossibilities</i> in nature. They best know that questions offer
themselves to thought, which Science, as now prosecuted, has not even
the tendency to solve. They keep such questions open, <i>and will not
tolerate any unlawful limitations of the horizon of their souls</i>.”
However weak and imperfect our spiritual vision may be at present, we
shall use each and every opportunity of obtaining all the information
that is possible, either from this world or the next. The report of the
committee chosen by the London Dialectical Society, to investigate the
subject of Spiritualism, “bears strong testimony in favor of the reality
of the manifestations,” and is a step in the right direction. All we ask
of our opponents, is fair treatment and an unprejudiced consideration of
the facts and phenomena which Spiritualism presents. We do not fear as
to the result.</p>

<p>But the objection which is most frequently urged against Spiritualism
is, that “it is immoral in its tendencies.” In my anxiety to prove all
things, I have also taken this matter into careful consideration, and
diligently compared the annals of crime in the so-called Christian
church with those of Spiritualism. For several years I have collected
the items from the daily newspapers, that I might have them for future
reference, and in due time come to a just and impartial conclusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a>{9}</span> As
I write, that record of ministerial delinquency, ecclesiastical
abominations, and human frailty, lies before me. Where I have found one
spiritual sheep that has gone astray, I have found ninety and nine of
the Shepherds in Israel in great need of repentance. Let the church
cleanse her own Augean stables before she utters one word in relation to
the immoralities of Spiritualism. Casting stones and calling hard names
will not profit either party. It is neither Christianity nor
Spiritualism that is responsible for these immoralities, but <i>poor human
nature</i>. The remedy lies not in creeds or forms of faith, but in the
growth of Truth in the Understanding, and Love in the heart. Not as a
Spiritualist, but as a child of humanity, do I hope that the entire
world may yet have a moral standard, harmonious with the laws of God and
Nature, and consistent with the highest good of the individual and
society.</p>

<p>Having, from inclination and a sense of duty to my kindred in the faith,
pursued the subject thus far, the “Spirit moves me” to present, in
conclusion, a few quotations which require neither comment nor
explanation.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If we are <i>wise</i> we shall sit down upon the brink and content
ourselves with saying what the spiritual world <i>is not</i> and <i>cannot
be.</i> * * The soul <i>must</i> be entirely ignorant of the second body
until it has ceased to use the first. * * The new organs, may be,
all correspond in intention and effect to the present ones; but we
say that <i>they do not yet exist.</i> <i>They cannot exist</i>; the ground
is pre-occupied.”</p>

<p class="r">
<i>John Weiss</i>,<br />
Unitarian Monthly Journal, May, 1866.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Moreover, the satellites of Jupiter are invisible to the naked
eye, and therefore can exercise no influence over the Earth, and
therefore would be useless, and therefore <i>do not exist</i>.”</p>

<p class="r">
<i>Francesco Sizzi</i>, Times of Galileo.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If the Spiritualists would secure the favor of <i>sensible people</i>
they must let them see that they are not at war with good sense. *
* It were better that very sacred and dear beliefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>{10}</span> should go, than
that this enemy of all rational belief should remain. Let us prefer
to have <i>no</i> other world, than to have another world full of
teasing, troublesome, meddlesome beings, who interfere with the
rational order of the world we dwell in.”</p>

<p class="r">
<i>O. B. Frothingham</i>,<br />
“The Index,” July 8, 1871.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“If the new planets were acknowledged, what a chaos would ensue!” *
* “I will never concede his four new planets to that Italian,
though I die for it.”</p>

<p class="r">
<i>Martin Horky</i>, Times of Galileo.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“O my beloved Kepler! How I wish we could have one good laugh
together! Here, at Padua, is the principal Professor of Philosophy,
whom I have repeatedly and urgently requested to look at the moon
and planets through my telescope, which he pertinaciously refuses
to do! Why, my dear Kepler, are you not here? What shouts of
laughter we should have at <i>all this solemn folly</i>!”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Hester Vaughn was tried for the crime of infanticide. She was
convicted, and sentence of death passed upon her. Subsequently, by
the efforts of benevolent individuals, and the pressure of public
opinion, her sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life. Susan
A. Smith, M. D., of Philadelphia, who visited her in prison, and
was chiefly instrumental in obtaining her reprieve, gives the
following statement in relation to the circumstances attendant upon
her alleged crime: “She was deserted by her husband, who knew she
had not a relative in America. She rented a third-story room in
this city (Philadelphia), from a German family, who understood very
little English. She furnished this room, found herself in food and
fuel for three months on twenty dollars. She was taken sick in this
room at midnight, on the 6th of February, and lingered until
Saturday morning, the 8th, when her child was born. She told me she
was nearly frozen, and fainted or went to sleep for a long time.
Through all this period of <i>agony</i> she was <i>alone</i>, without
<i>nourishment</i> or <i>fire</i>, with her door unfastened. It has been
asserted that she confessed her guilt. I can solemnly say in the
presence of Almighty God that she never confessed guilt to me, and
stoutly affirms that no such word ever passed her lips.”]</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Then said Mr. Greatheart, ‘I have a commandment to resist sin, to
overcome evil, to fight the good fight of faith; and I pray, with
whom should I fight this good fight, if not with Giant Despair?’</p>

<p>“Now Giant Despair, because he was a giant, thought no man could
overcome him; and again thought he, ‘Since heretofore I have made a
conquest of angels, shall Greatheart make me afraid?’ So he
harnessed himself and went out. Then they fought for their lives,
and Giant Despair was brought to the ground, but was loth to die.
He struggled hard, and had, as they say, as many lives as a cat;
but Greatheart was his death, for he left him not till he had
severed his head from his shoulders.”</p>

<h2><a name="THE_INNER_MYSTERY" id="THE_INNER_MYSTERY"></a>THE INNER MYSTERY.</h2>
<div class="blockquot"><p>The following inspirational poem was delivered at a festival
commemorative of the twentieth anniversary of the advent of Modern
Spiritualism, held in Music Hall, Boston, March 31, 1868.</p>

<p>It is an allegorical description of the progress of a soul from the
Valley of Superstition and Traditional Theology to the highest mountain
peaks of Natural Philosophy and Spiritual Revelation. He is strengthened
and encouraged in his progress by the voices “of the loved ones gone
before.” At length, in the higher regions of metaphysical reasoning and
abstract philosophy, he encounters the demon Doubt&mdash;a representative of
popular Theology and traditional authority. This Doubt endeavors to make
him distrust reason, and render a blind credence to mere authority. In
the struggle with the demon the great Truth flashes with a realizing
sense upon the soul, that by its inherent nature <i>it is older than all
forms of Truth, and one with God himself</i>. In the strength of this
conviction he conquers, and the demon is slain.</p>

<p>Thus “<span class="smcap">The Inner Mystery</span>” is revealed, and the unfolding of the spiritual
perceptions follows as a legitimate result.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“According to Fichte, there is a Divine Idea pervading the visible
universe; which visible universe is indeed but its symbol and
sensible manifestation, having in itself no meaning, or even true
existence, independent of it. To the mass of men this Divine Idea
lies hidden; yet to discern it, to seize it, and live wholly in it,
is the condition of all genuine virtue, knowledge, freedom, and the
end, therefore, of all spiritual effort in every age.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carlyle.</span></p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
